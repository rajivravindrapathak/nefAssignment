// Write code for the following problem, push your code to github and send us
// your github link as soon as you can. Use whatever framework you want to.
// Say that you have 5 stores and 5 recipes. 
// Assume that all stores are at the same distance from you(travel cost and time are the same to go
// to multiple stores too). Each recipe has different ingredients. Each store has coupons for different 
// ingredients with their own discount amount. Write code that will display the set of stores that would cost
//  minimum for a recipe.
